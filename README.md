# **Get_Next_Line**

WeThinkCode_ Core project  
Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious

### **Description**
The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

## Installation

Clone the get_next_line repo and change to the repo directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/veronar/get_next_line
cd ./get_next_line/get_next_line/
```

### Compilation

In order to use get_next_line in folder `./test_main` run the `Makefile` with the following command:

```
make
```

This will create an executable called `gnl` which will read from the `test.txt`.  
The main can be edited to open any other files & read from it accordingly.

If edits are made to get_next_line, it will need to be recompiled  
To recompile run the following command:

```
make re
```

Get_next_line is a function that is added to LibFT (1st WeThinkCode_ Core project), added to the libft.h header file and used as a part of LibFT.

## Usage

To use get_next_line `#include "get_next_line.h"` will need to be added to the list of included libraries & will need to be in the correct directory.
